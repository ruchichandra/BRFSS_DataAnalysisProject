# Exploring and Analysing BRFSS data


## Part 1: Data
The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the nationâ€™s premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. The interviewers collect data from randomly selected adult in a household in conducting BRFSS landline telephone survey and from an adult who participates by using a cellular telephone and resides in a private residence or college housing. BRFSS data was collectd through the random phone call surveys for non-institutionalized population., therefore the findings are generalized to US population that has either a landline telephone or cellular phone. This study is not generalized to those instituitionalized or those without telephones. Since all the data was collected (observed), this study is not based on any random experiment, hence there is no causal inference.
